A thrilling ride from start to finish!
Beautiful cinematography but the plot felt a bit slow.
I didn’t expect to cry this much — what a story.
Incredible performances that carried the entire film.
Visually stunning, but I wish the ending had more impact.
Had me hooked in the first 10 minutes.
Solid movie, though it played it a little too safe.
The soundtrack alone makes it worth watching.
Good concept, but the execution felt messy.
Absolutely hilarious — I couldn’t stop laughing.
The chemistry between the leads was perfect.
Predictable, but still entertaining.
